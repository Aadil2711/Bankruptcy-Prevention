The bankruptcy prevention project aims to develop a predictive model to identify companies at risk of bankruptcy.
By analyzing financial and non-financial data of companies, the project seeks to identify early warning signs and factors that contribute to bankruptcy. 
The project will utilize machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model that can classify companies as either at risk or not at risk of bankruptcy. 
The ultimate goal is to provide stakeholders, such as investors and creditors, with a tool to assess the financial health and stability of companies,
enabling them to make informed decisions and take proactive measures to prevent bankruptcy.
